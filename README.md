#ACME Insurance Medical Expenditure Estimation
<br>
##Overview
<br>
ACME Insurance Inc. requires an automated system to estimate the annual medical expenditure for new customers, using various factors such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region of residence. The goal is to use this estimation to determine the annual insurance premium offered to the customer. It is crucial for regulatory compliance that the system provides transparent explanations for its predictions.

This project implements a linear regression model to estimate medical charges based on historical data. The model is trained on a CSV file containing verified historical data with information about age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, region of residence, and the actual medical charges incurred by over 1300 customers. The dataset is sourced from Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets.
